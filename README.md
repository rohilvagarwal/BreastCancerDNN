**Team:** Matthew Cai (Nightxade) and Rohil Agarwal (rohilvagarwal)  
**Research Question:** Can a Deep Neural Network (DNN) effectively classify breast cancer from described features of digitized images of a fine needle aspirate (FNA), improving the accuracy and efficiency of breast cancer diagnosis?  
**Milestone Tasks:** (1) Preprocess and load dataset for model use. (2) Create model structure. (3) Train model. (4) Test model accuracy. (5) Create graphs.  
**Used Packages:** Numpy, PyTorch, and Matplot  
**Datasets:** Breast Cancer Diagnosis, Income Prediction (backup)  
**Data Considerations:** (1) The ID category should not be considered in the model. (2) Target category has a range of 2 values -- use binary classification (Sigmoid function for last neuron, Binary Cross Entropy Loss, 1 neuron for output). (3) All relevant features are continuous instead of categorical.  
**Results:** (1) Model performance with testing dataset results in a greater than 90% chance of a correct diagnosis.
