**Team:** Matthew Cai (Nightxade) and Rohil Agarwal (rohilvagarwal)  
**Research Question:** Can a Deep Neural Network (DNN) effectively classify breast cancer from described features of digitized images of a fine needle aspirate (FNA), improving the accuracy and efficiency of breast cancer diagnosis?  
**Projected Work:** (1) Preprocess and load dataset for model use. (2) Create model structure. (3) Develop training and testing methods.
**Potential Packages:** Pandas, Numpy, PyTorch  
**Datasets:** Breast Cancer Diagnosis, Income Prediction (backup)  
**Data Considerations:** (1) The ID category should not be considered in the model. (2) Target category has a range of 2 values -- use binary classification (Softmax function for last neuron, Binary Cross Entropy Loss, 1 neuron for output). (3) All relevant features are continuous instead of categorical.  
**Projected Results:** (1) Model performance with testing dataset results in a greater than 80% chance of a correct diagnosis.
